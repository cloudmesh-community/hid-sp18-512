# Google Cloud Compute

## Introduction

The very first cloud computing services goes back to about 2002 when Amazon released the AWS platform and exposed the technology to the rest of the world. It enabled technololgy experts to develop innovative applications and changed the way they are built. AWS had an early lead in the cloud computing and has continued to dominate the industry. The Elastic Cloud Compute Engine, a cloud-based virtual machine was one of their first innovations. Over the years, other competitors such as Microsoft, IBM, and Google came with their versions of the compute services that not only compete with Amazon, but continue to change the way developers build applications. With enterprise service-level agreements (SLA), Google launched their first compute engine service in 2013 and availed it to the general public. The Google Cloud Platform currently provides a myriad of services that span from storage,big data tools,networking et cetera. This tutorial will mainly focus on its compute stack, when to chose which service and how to get up and running with each.

## Core Google Compute Offerrings
This section summarizes the different compute offering in the google cloud infrastructure. 

### Google Compute Engine (GCE)

The google cloud compute is an infrastucture as a service offering that provides the power of creating virtual machines and the ability to alocate attributes such as memory, CPU, type of storage, and size of storage as well. It can be compared to building a whole computer with the ability to customizing the features according to your requirements and workloads.

### Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

Kubernetes is a container as a service that is basically an abstraction of the compute engine. It enables customers to run fully managed Docker containers. A container is a service that helps modularize applications. Kubernetes helps with the automation, management and the deployment of containers. 


### Google App Engine (GAE)

###  Google Cloud Functions — (FaaS)
